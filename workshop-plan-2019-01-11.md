Workshop plan
=============

January 11th 2019, NCVO, London

Aims and Objectives
-------------------

1. Validate and explore user groups
2. Produce user stories for use of the site
3. What are the questions they want to answer with the data

Would be good to also get a sense of objectives of the participants - want them
to get something out of the session too.

Programme
---------

Needs timings

### 1. Introduction

- Introduction to the project (DB)
- Where does this fit into other tools (DK)
- Go round table for introductions (all participants)
- Explain the process and aims for session (DK)

### 2. Explore user groups

(@TODO: define what we mean by user group here)

Everyone take post it notes. Write down potential site users, eg: 

- development NGOs (which staff/positions - need to be specific)
- academic researchers
- UK based/internationally based
 
Write as many as you can. Try to concentrate on groups you have direct knowledge of working with.
Maybe think about specific people that you've encountered.

Come together as a group - go round the table and share user groups. 

### 3. Produce user stories

Aiming for a collection of user stories that meet the following pattern:

**As a** `<USER>` **I want to** `<PERFORM ACTION>` **so I can** `<ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING>`

Give some examples (one from this domain, one silly one):

**As a** tea drinker **I want to** boil the kettle **so I can** have a hot cup of tea

Post-its again. Ensure that all three elements are present. Users should have appeared in the 
user groups session (or if we think of new ones could add them). 

Actions & outcomes should be as specific as possible - focus on a problem being solved, a change
that has occured or a question that is answered.

Again, sharing and discussion of user stories

### 4. (Potential if time) Prioritisation

Which are the highest priority? How are the user stories connected?

### 4. Sum up

Thanks people for their time. Admin for travel receipts, etc.
